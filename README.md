# Buildspace Wave Portal 👋

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

## How to use my project and wave at me?
 1. Go to my [wave-portal](https://waveportal-starter-project.reinbertvan.repl.co/).
 2. Make sure you have a [Metamask wallet](https://metamask.io/) and connect your wallet.
 3. Make sure you are on the right network on Metamask. Choose for Rinkeby testnetwork.
 4. 🤑 Getting some fake ether. 💲
    - There are a few testnets 🕸️ out there and the one we'll be using is called "Rinkeby" which is run by the Ethereum foundation.
    
    - In order to deploy to Rinkeby, we need fake ether. Why? Because if you were deploying to the actual Ethereum mainnet, you'd use real money! So, testnets copy how mainnet     works, only difference is no real money is involved.

    - In order to get fake ETH, we have to ask the network for some. This fake ETH will only work on this specific testnet. You can grab some fake ETH for Rinkeby through a faucet. Make sure that your MetaMask wallet is set to the "Rinkeby Test Network" before using faucet.
